        Abstract
        <br>
This paper present an experiment to show that there is an innate, natural human ability to bring 
forth what you seek from the randomness.  The experiment uses a binomial statistical test to show that 
humans can bring an image they seek from randomly drawn images.  It is common thought, that when you 
bring what you seek from the randomness, it is mere coincidence or random chance.  In all trials, 
the p-value was less than alpha, indicating that the null hypothesis (random chance) can be rejected 
in favor of the alternative hypothesis that there is a heart effect.   The implication is that certain 
people can use the mobile application Icebreakers as an intelligent semiotic device to warn of terrorist 
attacks or that everyone can use Icebreakers as a semiotic social media device to bring world peace. 

<br><br>
Introduction
<br>

Semiotics is the study of signs.  It is used in the hospitality industry to gauge customer trends as well as 
in the advertising industry to manipulate people into forming buying patterns, additions and habits.  
Humans encounter signs in their everyday life and religious scholars say that their respective books is a 
way for humans to understand and interpret the signs before them so that they may advance in life.

<br><br>
The defense industry has been trying to make an early warning semiotic device to learn of impending terrorist 
attacks and other disasters.  They have not been successful.  Most of their attempts has been at social 
scraping – the analysis of all the text on the internet for a given day or topic and to see if they can find 
some sort of signage.  The World Peace Catalyst Fund has made huge advancements in this area.

<br><br>
Starting from inspiration from the Alethiometer, a simple thought experiment was formed to see if it was 
possible to answer questions from randomly drawn images using symbols as the language.  An actual mobile 
application was made around 2018 to test this thought experiment.  Preliminary experimentation showed success.   
The application has evolved to have two main usages – the single person usage of the application as an 
intelligent semiotic device and the dual person usage of the application as a world peace semiotic social 
media application.

<br><br>
The single person usage of their application Icebreakers (formerly known as Ghost Writer Alpha) can act 
as an intelligent semiotic device to warn of impending terrorist attacks and other disasters. The dual 
person usage of the application can be used to safely foster heart based cross cultural conversations that 
efficiently reveal what separates us and what bonds us together.  The World Peace Catalyst Fund argues that 
the more we as humanity know about what separates us and what bonds us together, the closer humans will be 
to world peace.  To this end, WPCF has formalized an argument on a systemic social mechanism that seems to 
all but guarantee world peace. 

<br><br>
Both the single person usage of the application has shown positive results in preliminary testing.  The dual 
person usage of the application has not been tested yet, however both usages rely on the same principle.  
It is reasonable to assert that if the single person usage works, the dual person usage would work as well.  
The World Peace Catalyst Fund has provided theory in their report ‘Image Mediated Communication’ as to why 
the application would work.  They state that there is an innate ability of a human to bring forth what they 
seek from the randomness.  This effect, they call the heart effect.

<br><br>
The World Peace Catalyst Fund is organizing 3 experiments to prove that there is a heart effect and that this 
is not merely coincidence, random chance or hocus pocus.  This paper is the first experiment.  It shows that 
there seems to be an ability of the human to draw forth what they seek from the randomness.

<br><br>

     The heart

<br>
The heart is universally known as divine across all religions and cultures.  People associate the heart 
with feelings and emotions and they use the heart to try and feel things with their heart.  People also 
talk of the heart being in the right place, of putting their heart into it, of seeking with your heart, 
of following your heart, of manifesting things with their heart.  Anecdotally, it’s a universally accepted 
natural metaphysical phenomena.  To put numbers to it and to quantify this effect has been impossible until 
recently. 

<br><br>
From the scriptures, the heart is described as a divine center. People have received divine revelations from 
the heart.  Per Islam, the heart is a faculty of learning and knowledge.  It has been written that the heart 
is used to communicate with God.

<br><br>
This is another way of the Christian saying from the bible - ‘seek and you will find’.  This is another way to 
talk about the manifestation of what you seek from the randomness.  Is there anything to say that this ability 
does not come from the heart?

<br><br>
There are verses in the Quran that reveal a little bit about the heart.  The heartmath Institute has made some 
progress in the understanding of these verses and try to tie the physical effects directly to the heart. One of 
their major thesis or findings of the heart is that as you travel through the lands you learn and you understand 
with your heart.   

<br><br>

They tie in the electromagnetics of the land. As you move from place to place, the electromagnetics are different. 
The electromagnetics have to do with things like the Earth’s gravitational field, the radio waves around you, 
people’s heads generate waves radio waves are all sorts.  All these waves pass through the heart, they shape the 
heart and the person’s character. 


<br><br>
Until recently, there hasn’t been a way to characterize or quantify this phenomenon.  Doctors have created the 
electrocardiogram (EKG) that can check for different heart conditions.  The Heartmath institute has developed 
a way to characterize the EKG readings that correlate with behavioral and personality characteristics.   Yet, 
there still isn’t a way to measure the natural metaphysical phenomena that people speak and know of.  The 
phenomena being metaphysical in nature, naturally presents itself as a hard physical effect to see. This paper 
presents a way to characterize and quantify this natural metaphysical phenomena, which the world peace catalyst 
fund dubs the heart effect.

<br><br>
Coincidence?
<br>
To go into how this natural metaphysical phenomena can be characterized, the problem statement needs to be 
clearly identified.  When people start using their heart to manifest what they want or do the other number of 
things that can be done with the heart, it is akin to saying that people are using their heart to bring forth 
what they seek out of the randomness. So when people actually do manifest what they seek with their heart, is 
it random chance or is it some phenomena having to do with the heart?

<br><br>
There is a big unspoken internal debate between coincidence and things happening for a reason.  When things 
come together for a persons liking for no known reason, it is often described as coincidence and effect of 
random chance.  However, the religious knowledge base says there is no such thing as random chance, that 
things happen for a reason.  People often side with one or the other and is a cause for debate when things 
come together for no known reason.

<br><br>
The crux of this debate stems from the fact that when people try to manifest with their heart, it is an 
internal reaction.  There isn’t an explicit and concrete way to manifest with your heart.  The general 
steps are to form a thought, intention, to seek/wish and then perform some actions in that general direction.  
Other than the actions taken, everything else is internal.  When a person does manifest what they sought, it is 
not seen by that person as random chance.

<br><br>
When this person describes this manifestation, they say it is not coincidence.  However, the other person 
does describe this as coincidence and random chance – Just look at how many things had to come together.  
Naturally the following questions arise: Why you?  What makes you special?  Why isn’t this 
just serendipity?  The other person says it is just random chance, it is just a numbers game.

<br><br>
Experiment description
<br>
This experiment clearly shows that when you intentionally seek something with your heart and you 
manifest what you seek, it is not random chance.  The experiment is as follows: You think of a 
specific animal with your head/heart.  You type in the symbol animal into the single person usage 
of Icebreakers (Alethiometer).  You then scroll through the images of randomly chosen animals and 
see if the animal you thought of came up.  The animal should come up within x number of images where
 x is some threshold value.  It can be said that the stronger your heart is, the lower x will be.  
 For the purpose of this experiment, I set the threshold of x to be 1200. The hypothesis is that if a 
 person puts their heart into it, they can bring forth what they seek out of the randomness.

 <br><br>
 The experimental results are a series of yes/no answers.  Either your animal came up or it did not.  
 This forms a binomial distribution and this is a simple Bernoulli trial.  The binomial statistical 
 significance test can used to differentiate between the null and alternative hypothesis.  
 The hypothesis are:

            <td>
                The probability that the image you held in your heart/mind comes up is random chance.

                The probability that the image you held in your heart/mind comes up is based on a heart effect.

        <p class = "background container">
                Where P is the probability of drawing your image as random chance.  If there is a heart effect, 
                P will be greater than the random chance probability. P can also be described as the ability of 
                your heart to bring forth what you seek and is a way to numerically quantify and characterize your heart.

                <br><br>
                Lets define a general experiment. In a general experiment, you think of an animal in your head and 
                your heart. Let’s say you choose kangaroo and then in the application you type in the symbol animal. 
                The app retrieves 1200 random images with the hashtag animal. 

                <br><br>
                What is the probability of kangaroo showing in one of those 1200 images. Let’s say there are 50 million 
                images on the Internet with the hashtag animal.  How many of those images are of a kangaroo?  
                Defining the random chance probability to be 1%.  1% of 50,000,000 = 500,000 images of the kangaroo 
                on the Internet.  

                <br><br>
                Are there 500,000 images of the kangaroo on the internet? Probably, but there is also probably more 
                than 50 million images of animals on the internet. Are 1% of the images of animals on the internet of 
                kangaroos?  Probably not.  In fact, there is probably not 1% of any type of animals on the internet.  
                This isn’t an exact value, however it is usable.  Help will be needed to clearly hash out the actual 
                probability value of drawing an image you seek from x randomly drawn images on the internet.

                <br><br>
                Universal Language
                <br>
                Another aspect of this experiment is the concept of symbols as a universal language. In this experiment, 
                symbols are what is used to communicate with the heart/mind (internal realm) and 
                Internet (physical realm).  Everyone has their own language that stems from how they were 
                raised, what they learned, how they think and how they value things.   In the physical realm, 
                a symbol holds one shape which is recognized universally.  Yet, it can hold multiple meanings to 
                different people across the universe in the internal realm.  Furthermore, from the multitude of 
                meanings, it can take variable weightings based on the individual. 

                <br><br>
                Internet Image Database
                <br>
                Another aspect of this experiment is the huge trove of images on the internet.  This experiment 
                would not be able to be conducted before like 2015 and that’s because of the database of images 
                on the Internet. A quick google search reveals that as of November 2020, there are more than 4 
                trillion photos on the internet and that every week 28 billion new photos are added.  Because of 
                this it’s reasonable to assume that you can find an image of almost anything you want to see.  

                <br><br>
                Connecting Inner and Outer Realms
                <br>
                Connecting these two aspects, it can easily be seen that there is a clear path from what is meant 
                internally to what is presented externally.  For clarification, in this generalized experiment, 
                internally a person thinks kangaroo.  Externally, Kangaroo is represented with the symbol 
                animal.  While there are millions and millions of images tied with the symbol animal, since 
                there is a universality with symbols, the outer realm knows what is meant by the heart, if 
                there is a heart effect.

                <br><br>
                This experiment is designed to show that when you intentionally seek with your heart, you can 
                draw forth what you seek and that it is not coincidence or merely random chance.  This phenomenon 
                is the heart effect.

                <br><br>
                Method
                <br>
                This experiment was conducted using the mobile application Icebreakers available on android 
                devices or on pc’s with an emulator such as bluestacks.   It is reproducible at home easily. 
                Creating a profile with the application is the personalization process.  While there are a 
                number of fields, the only required fields are (Date of Birth, Gender, Country, City, Language, Ethnicity).

                <br><br>
                The experiment was done 3 times to show reproducibility and consistency.  Each experiment was a 
                Bernoulli trial and analysis based on the binomial distribution was done.  The first experiment 
                had 10 trials, the second experiment had 17 trials and the third experiment had 11 trials.   
                The date, time, image expected, time to focus and general notes were recorded.  Raw data can 
                be found in the appendix.

                <br><br>
                The experiment was done using the single person usage of the application (Alethiometer).  There 
                is no reset function, so to reset the image stream before each experiment, the symbols 
                Alpha&Omega/Anchor/Angel were chosen.  When the experiment was run, the symbol animal was 
                typed into the keyword chooser screen.  The images were then scrolled through until the 
                expected image came up or the image limit (1200) was reached.  If the expected image was 
                drawn the trial was a success, otherwise the trial was a failure.

                <br><br>
                In the experiment, special consideration needs to be taken as to what can be considered a 
                success and what is a failure.  It is clear that if the specific animal is drawn, then it 
                is a success.  However, what if the specific animal isn’t drawn, but a similar animal is?  
                For example, what if you thought German Shepard, but a bull dog is shown? Is this a success?  
                What if the specific animal isn’t drawn, but a relation to the image that is drawn to your 
                expected animal can be made?  For instance, what if you thought rabbit, but a fox is 
                shown (when I think fox, I also think rabbit – foxes love to eat rabbits)?

                <br><br>
                These are special circumstances and since a relation can be drawn to your expected animal, 
                it can be reasoned that your animal did come up in context.  In this type of contextual 
                reasoning, the animal shown could be a signifier to the animal expected.  For all intents and 
                purposes this would be considered a success.  The results of the experiment show the successes 
                based off exact results and relational results for comparison.  

                <br><br>
                Statistical analysis
                <br>
                This type of experiment fits the requirements for a binomial distribution and is thus subject to 
                the binomial statistical significance tests. The binomial distribution is described with 
                parameters n (number of trials) and p (assumed probability of success for each independent trial). 
                A series of these experiments is called a Bernoulli trial.  The requirements for a binomial 
                distribution are:  
                <br><br>
                1.	Binary outcomes (the image came or it did not)
                <br>
                2.	Independent observations (images are randomly drawn)
                <br>
                3.	Fixed n (number of trials)
                <br>
                4.	Same probability of success (p)
                <br><br>
                The binomial statistical test is a test to determine if you can reject a commonly accepted 
                hypothesis in favor of a new one.  The commonly accepted hypothesis is the null hypothesis and 
                states an assumed probability value (p0).  The new hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis and 
                proposes a new value for the probability of success. For a binomial distribution with an assumed 
                p value, the probability of k success occurring can be determined using the binomial 
                equation:
                <br><br>
                F(k,n,p) = nCk * (pk)(1-p)(n-k)
                <br>
                k= # of successes
                <br>
                n = number of trials
                <br>
                p = probability of success in a given trial
                <br><br>
                The binomial statistical test compares the probability of k success occurring, assuming a 
                probability of success (p0), to a threshold value (.  If the probability of k successes 
                occurring (p-value) is less than the  value, it is considered reasonable to reject the assumed 
                probability of success (p0) in favor of the an alternative probability.  When the p-value is 
                less than alpha, it is said that the chances of k successes occurring was so low, that the 
                assumed probability value (p0) is incorrect and that it is reasonable to consider the 
                alternative hypothesis.

    Table 1b: Results of the combined total of all three experiments broken down by exact and experimental
    <br><br>
    Discussion
    <br>
    In all trials, when considering both exact and relaƟonal successes, the null hypothesis can be rejected in
 favor of the alternaƟve hypothesis. When a person uses the mobile applicaƟon Icebreakers to draw
 what they seek, in the limit of 1200 images, it is not random chance that the image comes up. The
 means that is reasonable to suggest as the World Peace Catalyst Fund does that there is an innate
 human ability to draw forth what we seek from the randomness. 
<br><br>
It is important to note that a binomial staƟsƟcal test only allows for denial of the null hypothesis in favor
 of an alternaƟve hypothesis. For purposes of discussion, it should be noted that there may be another
 reason for this effect. For example, there may be a clairvoyance effect instead of a heart effect. A
 person may just have an innate ability to foresee to a certain extent what will come next. The ability to
 see that a single animal out of 1200 randomly chosen images may be part of that extent. There may be
 another experiment that can be done to differenƟate between the two. For the intents and purposes of
 the World Peace Catalyst Fund, the explanaƟon of the heart phenomena makes the most sense. 
<br><br>
There is a huge difference in the number of successes occurring based on direct successes versus
 relaƟonal successes. The average of successes based on exact results is 36.84%, compared to 81.58% for
 relaƟonal results. This supports the claim that an intelligent semioƟc device used by the right person can
 provide accurate results well over the majority of the Ɵme, to the limit of 100%. 
<br><br>
Perusing the raw data, there were a few observaƟons the scienƟst noted from this exploratory study.
 The first being that more successes were recorded when there was no Ɵme given to ruminate or have
 the thought sink in. This indicates that the heart effect may be more impulsive and instantaneous than
 originally thought. The saying live in the moment comes to mind and maybe the heart effect comes alive
 in the moment. 

<br><br>
The heart effect may have similariƟes to electricity flow through a wire if you think of the heart as a
 baƩery. The fact that the heart effect can bring up the desired image from randomly drawn images is
 like the fact that a baƩery can push electric current through a wire. A baƩeries strength is measured in
 voltage and is the ability to push the electrons through the wire with x force. The hearts strength may
 be measured in how soon the image desired shows up (within the first x images). 
<br><br>
Its not enƟrely clear what makes the effect bring the image sooner. When the experiment was done
 consistently aŌer prayer, more successes were recorded. The Muslim view of prayer is that it is like a
 meeƟng with God, which is probably similar to other religions. MeeƟng with God would surely
 strengthen your heart. Yoga may be another way to strengthen the heart. Improving your reasoning
 ability by reading and wriƟng may be another way. More discussion and experimentaƟon will have to
 be needed to determine some sort of systemic procedure that helps to induce the heart effect
 consistently and effecƟvely.
<br><br>
This heart effect is invisible and metaphysical in nature. The heartmath insƟtute is looking for ways to
 measure and characterize the heart. Another binomial staƟsƟcal test can be done to test the validity of
 the following type of hypothesis: 
<br><br>
H0: My heart is P0 percentage good. P=P0
<br><br>
Ha: My heart is less than P0 percentage good. P< P0
<br><br>
P-value = Pk:n,p
<br><br>
In this binomial test, if the P-value > then the null hypothesis can be rejected. Excel was used to
 determine the P0 at which the null hypothesizes cannot be rejected at an Using the total
 values from all three combined experiments, P0 was determined to be 91.03% for the scientist
 conducing the experimentation. 
<br><br>
This number is to be understood that a person is able to bring forth what they seek out of the randomness P0 of the time. 
This can be a grading of the heart of an individual.  This heart grade may reveal other attributes of a person such as if
morally straight, mentally fit or spiritually strong.  This type of rationale leads to the idea that a person may improve their
heart grade with prescribed activities which is for another discussion.  In addition, per Islamic throught, many diseases
originate with a problem associated with the heart, this may be a way to 
diagnose the heart.
<br><br>
The ability to improve the heart grade may have something to do with some sort of spiritual 
enlightenment, some sort of physical capacity and or some sort of connection with God and 
the divine.  The ability varies not based on what religion you follow, but how 
in tune you are with your heart.  Mastering your deen may be the way to improve
your heart grade.  in respect to which religion it may work best in, each person follows a book.
Each book teaches more or less the same general principles albeit in differnt workdings. 
The religion may not matter, rather the individuals symbolic reasoning developed from 
their particular religious understanding may matter.

<br><br>
If this experiment were to be conducted by the masses, a distribution could be formed.  It would 
be interesting to see the mean and standard deviation of such a distribution.  The heartmath
institute was seeking to establish a global heart coherence.  This may fit into
their grand scheme as a measure of gloval heart coherence.  In addition, it may serve
as a measure for the spiritual, religious and political communities to 
guage the population with the goal of constanly improving the heart grade
distribution.  World PEace Catalyst Fund plans to provide instructions for the masses to perform
this experimentation on their own and submit the results so such a distrubtion may be constructed.

<br><br>
There is probably some type of taxonomy of things that can be brought forth and within those individual classifications, 
there may be distinct and different heart grades.  This expeeriment is simple, it can be reproduced easily and there are many other 
experiments that are in the same level.  An example would include thinking of a specific food and typing in food as the 
symbol.  The need for a classification becomes apparent when one starts thinking about the types of questions that could be answered
with this type of device.
<br><br>
Not much is known about how the metaphysical apsects of the heart works.  The rationalization that as the
heart understands and learns as it trabels through the land lends itself to there being some 
sort of electromagnetic tie in.  In any event, it would be fruitful to vonverse over how the 
random images are chosen.
<br><br>
The images are loaded to databases and are held in some memory location with some sort of indexing and characterization tied to it
such that the images sought can be brought forth.  To retrieve the images, electrons would 
have to pass through the cicuitry to the desired memory location and then transfer the stored 
data back to the user.  When a rsnomization element is added, how does the electrons know which way
to tranves through the sservers to land at the image desired?

One reason is that at the level of an electron, small forces may be enough to influence the direction that
the electron travels through the circuit.  This small force may be induced by the heart, assuming
that there is an electromagnetic tie.  Through electromagnetics, the heart may be 
able to guide the electron through the wiring to the location desired by the heart.  This is a
philosophical inquiry that would need to be addressed to understand this thing.
<br><br>
Another possible way to rationalize this effect is to assume that there is a heart pressure.
When you seek something with your heart, the heart may exert a pressure of sorts.  
Assume that each image and each written word also exerts a pressure of sorts.  Perhaps when 
there is a pressure matching, the thing you seek comes forth.  There may also be an 
anti-presssure exerted such that it repels this matching.  The anti-pressure may 
be spread out over all the images.  The more images there are, the less
anti-pressure there is and thus the heart is able to exert its force.
<br><br>
This explanation shows why an individual cannot use their heart to pick out the winning
lottery number.  There are only one of each of the 10 possible numbers to choose from, the 
anti-pressure would be to great on each number for the heart to overcome and thus cannot exert its force.  With 
images from the interent, there are millions of each possibl eimage type and thus the anti-pressure becomes
infinitesimally small as it spreads out over a large number of images, aloowing the heart to exert its force.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>


This experiment confirms what has been known anecdotally for quite some time - That things happen
for a reason.  It also provides a green light for the work of the World Peace Catalyst Fund and 
provides investors and philanthropists reason to pump money into the nonprofit.

<br><br>
Further experimentation will be done to see if the heart effect can also be used to answer
questions formed through symbols.  Preliminary testing already shows that this 
is significant given a P0<1% - the application has answered questions more 
than 2 times which is enough to say that there is an effect.  Formalization 
of the experiment will be needed.  This success means that Icebreakers can 
be used as an intelligent semiotic device to warn off terrorist attacks and 
impending disasters.
<br><br>
More philosophical work will need to be done to hash out specifics such as who can answer 
which types of questions.  Those that can answer the question 'What are terrorists 
planning today for tomorrow?' successfully can be considered the first jedi.  Research 
and development work can be done to fine tune this device to near 100% success.
<br><br>
Further experimentation will be done to test if the dual person usage of the application can be 
used to efficiently bring images that show the two users what separates them or 
what bonds them.  Since this is a mobile application, anyone with digital 
access can play this connect the dots game, meaning that at any one moment, 
there may be millions or billions of cross cultural conversations and the 
social bonds of society being revealed.  From the many cross cultural conversations, 
they can be sent in for centralized analysis by the WPCF which can then pull out
the common themes of bonding.  These common themes of bonding can then be 
magnified and sent to the billions of peopl in the world to enhance 
social bonding and thus bring world peace.
<br><br>
WPCF already has an argument that has yet to be countered on a systemic social mechanism that seems to 
all but guarantee world peace.  Their reasoning suggests that in conflict areas, such as Israel/Palestine,
Russia/Ukraine or any other region, peace cna be brought about in a matter of weeks With
 mass systemic questioning.  Succesful experimentation will prove Icebreakers to 
 be a catalyst for world peace.
