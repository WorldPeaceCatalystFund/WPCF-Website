      Every cross-cultural conversation on Icebreakers is a heart-thread/brick of peace (however you view it).
      Each conversation brings us 1 chat closer to world peace.  Users send the short conversations 
      in for review and WPCF determines the bonds of society (concpets/thoughts/things/ideas) that bring people 
      together and amplifies them through social media and public policy to bring and maintain a lasting peace.
