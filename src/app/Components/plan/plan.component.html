<h2> After Action Report of 2023 Strategic Plan</h2>
<br><br>
    <p>
2023 had 4 main priority areas: Grants & Donations, Advertising, Social Media Prescence and
 General Maintenance. We met many milestones in all areas, however WPCF was unable to meet all 
 goals set.  This should not be a deterrent from supporting us – Rome was not built in a day; 
 It takes many failures to succeed only once.  
Before we begin our plan for 2024, we will go over the 4 priority areas in brief.

</p>

<br><br>
<h3>Grants & Donations - FY23 Overview</h3>
<br><br>
<p>
    WPCF maintained good standing with Google ad Grants and we were able to spend every penny of the $120k allotted to us.  
    With the money, WPCF was able to identify 2 target regions – Africa (Nigeria) and India Subcontinent 
    (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh).  Analytics has allowed to narrow in on the cities in that region which 
    we plan to capitalize on in 2024.  
    <br><br>
    We applied to 30 grants from the Department of State for a total of $1.794 million dollars.  None of those 
    grants was awarded to us, which we find upsetting and an indicator that something is wrong there.  Our 
    expectation is that there should be at least one grant awarded to us.  None the less, WPCF will continue to 
    establish connections with the Department of State and tweaking our proposals until we hit a winning format.  
    We believe the concepts and logical arguments are a winner – wording is a whole other issue and is where we 
    are encountering our problems.
    <br><br>
    We will still make an attempt to invoke the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to see why WPCF was not awarded 
    any grants from them last year.  Our original thinking was that, with our credentials, if we provide an argument 
    for a systemic social mechanism that seems to all but guarantee peace – the Department of State should be the 
    ones to either quickly provide us with the money to try it or to provide a counter rationale as to why it 
    wouldn’t work.  Neither of this happens, which leads us to believe that there is funny business going on 
    and it is our duty to investigate. In the event that we are at fault, it is still worthwhile to learn 
    about the legal system and this will raise our awareness in the government.
    <br><br>
    WCPF has collected $1 total donations in 2023. While this is a small amount, it does represent our first 
    donation and we believe it is a sign of great things to come.  In fact, there was actually an attempt to 
    donate about $5,000 to WPCF, however the previous donation system broke down without us realizing 
    (we are severely short staffed).  It wasn’t until December 2023 that this was realized and the payment 
    system was rebuilt using a more widely accepted 3rd party – Stripe.  WPCF can now accept payments in many 
    methods and across 135+ currencies.
    <br><br>
    WPCF also had an unplanned Giving Tuesday Campaign.  It was unsuccessful, no one participated in our 
    social media campaign and no one donated.  WPCF gives itself a pat on the back for trying.  We are still 
    a young organization with no actual impact made – It is almost impossible to do anything without $$$ 
    these days, which we have little of.  We still maintain that we are the strongest force for World Peace 
    and remain hopeful that people will start to open their hearts and minds to our systemic social mechanism.
    <br><br>
    WPCF also found out about the AWS grant and is in the works of getting it approved.
    <br><br>


</p>

<h3>Advertising - FY23 Overview</h3>
<br><br>
<p>
    We had a successful year in advertising.  Of our identified 1500 funnels, we have planned 
    about 4% and have implemented 2%.  While not complete, it has driven traffic to all of our 
    webpages. It brought us 345k clicks, at an average cost of $0.31 cents per viewer.  
    <br><br>
    The first half of the year was spent building and implementing the platform.  Starting from about 
    May, work on advertising was put on hiatus and just set to run.  While running, we were collecting 
    data with google analytics.  It has helped identify the target regions.  We are also seeing a steady 
    increase in the number of users and installs of the device.  July 2023 saw an all-time low of 200 
    users, while at the time of writing this, Icebreakers is at a level of 500 users – more than double in just 6 months.  
    <br><br>

</p>

<h3>Social Media Prescence - FY23 Overview</h3>
<br><br>
<p>
    WPCF ran into setbacks in our Social Media Campaign.  We did not have time to develop enough content to 
    start posting.  It wasn’t until late December that planning for a Social Media Campaign began to pick up.  
    There was some activity in the early part of the year.  We are on the radar of some big names in social 
    media in the nonprofit, military, embassies, congressman, and models. 
    <br><br>
    WPCF opened up a reddit subtopic twice, only to be banned for spam.  The reason seemed nonsensical 
    and unfair – maybe some sort of discrimination.  
    WPCF has actually created world peace memes – 55 of them (5 different texts, each available in 11 
    different peace colors).  They are available online for download and distribution.  This was 
    unexpected but is a great advancement in the social arena.  Our followers can now post one of the 
    memes to help create a world peace mindset on social media.  The popularity of the memes are not 
    at the level we want it to be (almost non-existent outside of our accounts) but we will take things one 
    step at a time and hope to see it all over the internet.
    <br><br>
    We continued to reach out to models this year.  We were invited to attend DC Swim Week and made a 
    few contacts in the fashion industry.  Hopefully WPCF will be able to capitalize on our connections 
    and continue with our plans to incorporate the beauty of women into the beauty of peace.
    <br><br>
    While developing our social media strategy, WPCF actually coined a few games that can be played 
    with Icebreakers.  This was a new development and is a success in the social media arena.
    
    <br><br>

</p>
<h3>General Maintenance - FY23 Overview</h3>
<br><br>
<p>
    The site remains up and running.  The email capture platform is healthy.  The donation system is 
    currently working.  There was a lapse in coverage of the donation system for a few 
    months – not to worry, WPCF is still young and not yet garnering a steady stream of donations.
    <br><br>
    There has not been much time to work on what needs to be updated.  This includes a 
    large number of things including the mobile application, updates to the argument, email 
    analytics, updating the website to be mobile friendly.  
    <br><br>
    A tremendous amount of research was done in 2023. 20+ books were read pertaining to 
    various subjects around running a nonprofit, growing a mobile app, and selling on the 
    internet.  All of this will be put into good use over the coming years and will be 
    referred back to as WPCF builds our own knowledge base of tactics and strategies build off this research.
    <br><br>
    Email newsletters stopped around June.  WPCF plans to pick them up soon in 2024 and 
    hopefully will be able to continue writing them throughout the year.  Currently we 
    have 240+ subscribers.  While we did have our newsletters going, we started a report 
    card and will continue to report on our metrics to describe our efficiency.
    <br><br>

</p>>
<h3>MISC Updates - FY23 Overview</h3>
<br><br>

<p>
    Our work is theoretical and is based off a priori rationalization.  Our argument on the systemic 
    social mechanism that seems to all but guarantee world peace has been out for a year and 
    is still uncontested.  The whole thing is experimental and the extent of the impact cannot 
    be known until it has been tried, which we are looking for money for.  To this point, WPCF 
    has identified 3 experiments that strengthen our argument and position on the mechanism.  
    The first experiment has been conducted, multiple times with positive results – experimentation 
    clearly shows that the human heart has the ability to draw forth what we seek from the randomness. 
     2023 ended before the other 2 heart experiments could be conducted.
     <br><br>
    WPCF also completed some SEO work.  We, are not, fully SE optimized, but we made, an effort in this arena.
    <br><br>
</p>

<h2> Strategic Plan for 2024</h2>

<p>
    World Peace Catalyst Fund is still surviving, and although, we are not yet thriving, 
    we are seeing steady improvements, and making strides to reach the next level.  I 
    think, we made great progress in 2023, and increased our capacity. I plan, to 
    increase our scope in 2024.  2024 will see more work, in more focus areas.  The 8 
    focus areas in 2024 area: Grants, Donations and Investors, Advertising, Social Media Prescence, 
    Code Updates, Experimentation, General Maintenance, Research & Development, Volunteering.
</p>

     <br><br>
     <h1>Grants, Donations, Investors - FY24</h1>
     <br><br>
     <p> 
        WPCF currently only has 1 grant secured which is the Google Ad Grants.  It allows us $10k a month to 
        spend on advertising, and we use every penny of that money to expand our reach.  We, will 
        continue to maintain a good relation with Google to keep the Grant.  Through it, we, 
        already have been seen, by more than a quarter, of one million people, and, we have doubled our 
        mobile app usage. 
        <br><br>
        Amazon has a grant of $1k a year to spend on Amazon web services.  Most of the IT 
        infrastructure for WPCF is built on AWS.  Our current spend is about $1.5k a year, so this 
        grant will help to handle the burden of this cost.  We applied for it in December and are 
        currently waiting for approval.
        <br><br>
        WPCF is currently advertising for nearly every page of our site.  We, have added new webpages, 
        since we last touched, the advertising funnel, so we will have to add new advertisements, to 
        cover those webpages.  WPCF has only designed 5% of the platform and implemented 2% of the 
        platform.  Most of the advertisements cover the donation and mobile application funnels.  
        We will create more funnels for the heart experiment and social media memes this year.  We will also 
        start to plan experiments to hone the funnels for maximum conversions.
        <br><br>
        WPCF has used google analytics to identify key cities that have our target market.  We will 
        capitalize on this information to concentrate and grow the use of the application.  Now, that we 
        have a geographical area identified and we can narrow down to the customer avatar that is 
        attracting this group, we can focus our efforts to serve this market.  It will act as a 
        nucleation site to grow peace.
        <br><br>
        WPCF will continue to apply to Department of State (DOS) grants this year.  We, are also 
        going to attempt to extend, our grant applications to the Department of Defense (DOD), the 
        National Science Foundation (NSF), National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), and the National 
        Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).  There, is no guarantee we will get any of these grants, 
        however we will take the initiative to work towards them.  In due time, they will be ours.
        <br><br>
        This broadens our scope in our grant outreach.  The heart experiment we just conducted, 
        strengthens our position in the grant proposals. We have good reasoning to be funded in 
        all those areas.  We are not sure if we will be, given that we are new and the current 
        state of the world.  We will try to hold the grantors responsible for their actions, albeit 
        we are not sure how to.  If you have any suggestions, please let us know.
        <br><br>
        We have a PhD from the religious fields on board.  We are using him to do research to 
        further strengthen ourselves.  As he gets involved, we will look for grants in his field 
        that we can apply to so that we can pay him fulltime to work for us.
        <br><br>
        As we are getting underway and still have no steady source of revenue, I thought of opening 
        the doors for investors by starting a B-corporation (Benefit Corporation).  A B-Corporation 
        allows a company to raise money by issuing stocks (Standard way investors invest in a company) 
        and functions just like a normal business but without the need to make business decisions geared 
        toward maximizing shareholder profit.  A benefit corporation is a corporation geared to benefiting 
        humanity and thus so, the business decisions of a B-corp are geared toward maximizing it’s benefits 
        towards humanity instead of shareholder profit.  However, for this to happen, I will need to hear 
        from investors and as of yet, I’ve heard nothing.
        <br><br>
        Last year was our first attempt at a Giving Tuesday Campaign and it was unsuccessful.  We did not
         plan or prepare for much of it, it was ad-hoc.  This year, we hope to plan and prepare so that we 
         can raise a significant amount of money and cause a sensation.  It will include memes, hashtag and 
         a social media campaign.
         <br><br>

     </p>
        
        <br><br>
        <h1>Advertising - FY24</h1>
                <br>
                <br>
<p>
    We made great progress in advertising last year.  We hope to capitalize on what we learned last year 
    to make more advancements this year.  The focus is still on awareness and virality.  Now that we 
    have a customer avatar and geographical regions identified, we will experiment on different advertising 
    techniques to create a spark for virality.
    <br><br>
    The advertising platform has not been touched for about 6 months and we have added new web 
    pages, so standard work will be to add in advertisements to drive traffic to those pages.  We 
    will also start funnel experiments, running at either every 2 weeks or for however long to attain 
    100 page viewers.  The goal being to find something that converts.
    <br><br>
    The new web pages that were added are convertible actions.  They include the heart affect 
    experiments for our users to try at home, new games users can play on the app and social media memes 
    that users can post to help create a world peace mindset.  
    <br><br>
    Currently, we are targeting major international cities around the world.  If our experiments are not 
    working in those cities, we will attempt to run them in other cities, again with the attempt to 
    find geographical regions who are primed for our systemic social mechanism.
              
</p>
                <br>
                <br>
<h1> Social Media Prescensce - FY24</h1>
<br><br>
<p>
    There has not been to much activity on our social media accounts – mainly because I was asked to 
    stop making social media posts by my company – all the more reason you should donate so I can turn 
    this into my full time job and continue posting again.  In the mean time, I have been researching 
    on content to post and social media strategies to try.
    <br><br>
    I have a plan to create 1 years worth of social media content for a Facebook group, Facebook Page 
    and Instagram page.  Now I need to actually make the posts. I don’t have much time myself, so I will 
    probably start paying someone to make the posts and will save them until I have fully transitioned 
    into running this nonprofit full time.
    <br><br>
    WPCF had setup a reddit forum a couple of times so people can log on and leave feedback, provide 
    critique or counter arguments to what I have written.  Twice now it has been shut down for spam – I am 
    saying this is funny business.  Anway, WPCF is either going to setup a commenting system, their own 
    forum or look for a reddit alternatives for our followers to leave feedback  and critique on.
    <br><br>
    WPCF is pleased to have created 55 world peace memes this past year.  We hope to create more 
    generalized world peace memes in addition to specific conflict world peace memes.  Posting of these 
    memes helps spread awareness of WPCF as well as help to create social pressure to push for peace and 
    helps to create a world peace mindset.  WPCF is thinking of developing some sort of World Peace 
    Ambassadors program, where a person can post a world peace meme once a week for an entire year to 
    help create the atmosphere of peace on social media.  There may be a possibility to pay for this, 
    however, we hope it would just be fun for the person to post these memes up.
    <br><br>
    WPCF has developed 5 games so far including adult hide and seek, terrorist hunter killer, seek 
    your love, find your BFF and hone your heart.  WPCF will develop memes for these games to help 
    spread their popularity.  We think the idea of multiple games being played on Icebreakers would 
    help popularize it.
    <br><br>
    Lastly, there has been concerns about my seriousness in leading WPCF.  I don’t know what to 
    tell them.  I am a male, I have a member, a large number of the things I do will seem stupid.  I can’t get 
    around that.  Anyway, I can’t see anyone who would have done a better job with the lack of 
    resources.  I am pretty much bootstrapping everything, am making good progress and am adjusting my 
    life to live and breathe this.  However, I thought it would be great to start doing a live stream 
    at some regular frequency so my followers can get to know me and get a feel for how I do things.
    <br><br>
    WPCF will still reach out to models to incorporate them into our social media strategy.  We hope to 
    use them to present our symbols like Vanna White shows the letters in Wheel of Fortune.  What 
    better way to celebrate the beauty of peace with the beauty of women!

        <h1>Code updates - FY24</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            WPCF has grown steadily over the last 6 months.  I expect there to be exponential growth 
            this year as we focus and hone the advertising funnels.  With this in mind, we are 
            in for a lot of code updates.  This is where the heavy work will be.  I was hoping to have 
            funding by now so that I can delegate this work, however as there is nothing in the bank 
            account, this is something I will also have to bootstrap.
            <br><br>
            AWS lambda is updating their codebase to NodeJS 20.x and phasing out support 
            for NodeJS 16.x.  All of my lambda functions work off NodeJS 16.x and I will have to sit 
            and spend some time writing code updates for this.  The email capture system and the 
            donation system works off AWS lambda.  Both of these are critical features and cannot be ignored.
            <br><br>
            The mobile application is built off of Java platform and is available on android devices, 
            however since the start of this, it has been asked when will it be available to apple 
            devices.  I hope to extend the reach of the application to all those with internet 
            access.  To do this, I plan to make the code cross-platform.  I will do this by re-writing 
            everything in C++, releasing the web version of the application, then the android version 
            and lastly the apple ios version.  There is no telling how long this will take, but coding 
            is something I find fun and I hope to start on this soon.  I think this is called a 
            game engine….I’m making the game engine for world peace, lol.
            <br><br>
            Another thing that will have to be coded is the mobile friendly version of the website.  The 
            majority of our website visits are on mobile devices and the site is not geared towards 
            mobile devices.  While still usable, it is definitely not optimized.  It is very important 
            to be able to have mobile users able to navigate through the site with ease.
            <br><br>
            In addition to coders, testers will also need to be involved.  The mobile application is 
            already very buggy and the website probably has a number of problems with it.
            <br><br>
            That is 5 big pieces of code that needs to be worked on.  I can do it myself, however 
            it will take time.  If I had money, it would go faster because I could outsource the 
            work.  The other alternative I have, is to make the program opensource.  I’m still mulling 
            over the details, what can be made available to the public, what has to be kept private.

        <h1>Experimentation - FY24</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            All of this has been created with pre-liminary experimentation.  I know enough math and 
            science to know that its not just coincidence that Icebreakers can answer questions.  However, no 
            one will give money without proper proof.  Hence the need for writing I produced.  The 
            writing provides rational a-priori for what I am saying.  However, there may be something 
            overlook or missed that can only be known after the fact, something a-posteri.  This is
             where experimentation comes in.  There are 3 experiments that can be done that go on 
             to bolster our position and prove our systemic social mechanism that seems to all but 
             guarantee peace would work.
             <br><br>
            The first heart effect experiment is to show that humans have an ability to draw 
            forth what they seek with their heart. The scope of this experiment was conducted was 
            in drawing a specific animal from the category of animals.  The experiment was successful 
            and reproduced to meet the standards of science.  WPCF has written up instructions for our 
            followers to reproduce the experiment on our site.
            <br><br>
            The second heart effect experiment is to show that humans have an ability to draw forth 
            an answer to questions they have with their heart.  This experiment is currently underway, and 
            it is very successful.  I have not completed all the trials yet, however I know enough math 
            and science to say that even if the subsequent trials were a failure, I have enough trials 
            that were a success to be able to say that humans do have an ability to draw forth an answer to 
            questions they have with their heart.
            <br><br>
            The third heart effect experiment is to show that paired humans have ability to draw forth 
            an answer to questions they seek together with their heart.  This experiment is expected 
            to be conducted later on in the year.  I am excited for this experiment because success 
            here means we can reveal the bonds of society to a higher degree of efficiency.  Some people 
            can already see it will be a success, but good things take time and the proper way to do 
            things is to document the results, which will take time.
            <br><br>
            I believe I have enough to go to the sciences and say hey you should really give me 
            money, which is what I am trying to do this year.  In any case, once all experiments are 
            completed and people start reproducing the results on their own at home, it will become very 
            hard for anyone to refute what I am saying.
            <br><br>

            <h1>Research & development - FY24</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                WPCF has a backbone argument written, uncited and some experiments that go to 
                prove what we are saying.  Although our work in uncited, I know there is similar 
                research work being done in academia and other spaces that tie in.  For example, the 
                heartmath institute work ties directly to what WPCF has shown.  All of this means that 
                we need to spend some time doing research and development.
                <br><br>
                There are a number of different academic fields that this work applies to, like science & 
                engineering, theology, linguistics and math.  WPCF is currently in talks with one PhD from 
                the theology field.  We hope to find work that will bolster and propel his career while 
                strengthening our position and advancing ourselves as the application to use.
                <br><br>
                This year may just be spent outlining and hashing out what can be done and which 
                directions we can take this in.  We will do this while keeping an eye out for grants 
                and sources of money, so in subsequent years we can actually take action.  
                <br><br>
                There is potential to land ourselves in academic journals and create classes of our work.
                <br><br>

            </p>
        
        <h1>Volunteering - FY24</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            WPCF is seeing an increased workload and thus will place more on an emphasis in 
            volunteering.  A volunteering funnel may be needed for this.  Our primary 
            strategy will be to reach out to particular departments in colleges and high schools 
            and let the faculty and staff know of volunteer opportunities WPCF has.  This will hopefully 
            reduce the workload for me, increase our awareness and help get the work that needs to be done, done. 
            <br><br>

        </p>
        <h1>General Maintenance - FY24</h1>
        <br><br>
        
        <p>
            WPCF has grown significantly, and although we are still small, we have 
            an increasing public presence.  We went from a single static web page to 
            a full blown web application with available downloads, email capture system and a 
            donation payment system.  All of this involves heavy code and many moving parts that 
            need to be maintained.
            <br><br>
            This will be work to be done in the mean time, hopefully with the help of staff or 
            volunteers.  This work includes writing the bi-monthly newsletters.  I stopped that in 
            July of last year to take care of other endeavors.  I will pick that back up within the next 
            week, of writing this.  I also have customized reports coded in to help me metricize the efficiency 
            of what I’m doing.  Those will need to be updated with new information.  I need to maintain the 
            SEO on google search console so we come up in organic searches.  I will also have to maintain the 
            Google Analytics platform so we have the most up to date data and make the best use of google analytics.
            <br><br>
        </p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            WPCF is still small, but we have grown significantly in the past year.  We are growing 
            steady right now, and we hope to achieve exponential growth in the next year.  I am 
            working to update the code so that we can handle this growth. I am also working to get 
            other people to start doing the work, whether this be through paid contracts or volunteer work.
            <br><br>
This strategic plan highlights areas of our focus.  By focusing on these 8 areas, I will bring WPCF 
up to a level where we have made an impact or are poised to make an impact.  I will remain agile to attend 
to more pressing matters as they rise.  
<br><br>
WPCF is still the strongest force for World Peace.  My argument on the systemic social mechanism that 
seems to all but guarantee peace is still uncontested and still we are unfunded.  Will all this work just 
be in vein?  I hope not, but time will tell.
