    <h2 class = "header background container"> WPCF thought you would, so we assembled this page so you can push the world 
      closer to peace before the hour is done

    </h2>
    <br>
    <h3> What other World Peace Non-Profit can say this?</h3>
<br><br>
    <h3> The Basics:</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p class = "background container">
     World Peace Catalyst Fund (WPCF) argues that the more we learn about what separtes us and what bonds us, the closer 
     we will be to world peace.  The only way this will happen is if we start conversing enough with each other - 
     cross-cultural conversations. To this end, WPCF provides a semiotic social media application, Icebreakers,
      that reduces the 
     communication barrier by 90% and employs the heart effect to allow for safe, easy and effective heart based 
     cross-cultural, connect the dots style conversations.  Each conversation is a metaphysical reaction that can 
     show us a bond of society. Each conversation is a brick in the house of peace.
      WPCF can then magnify these bonds of society to create a social atmoshpere that is 
     adverse to violence.  WPCF has created and written about 
     a systemic social mechanism designed around the application, Icebreakers.  
     <br><br>
     
     </p>
    <h3>  WPCF brings 2 technological advancments and new mathematical insight</h3>
    <p class = "background container">
    <br><br>
    <b>The Heart Effect</b> - In Icebreakers, you pose a question by selecting a few symbols to represent the question.  
    The application then goes to the interent and retrieves randomly drawn images based off those questions.  The 
    application then assembles the images into a feed.  WPCF says that there should be a message in that feed of images 
    that answers your question.  Science says this should never happen as these images are randomly drawn, however, 
    experimentation is showing otherwise - messages are formed a majority of the time.  WPCF is coining this 
    the heart effect - the innate human ability to draw forth what it seeks with their heart.  Don't take our word for it,
    we have  <a routerLink="/GWAExp1" >experimentation</a> you can do 
    on your own to prove to yourself that you can use Icebreakers to answer 
    your questions.
<br><br>
<b>Reduction of the communication barrier by 90%</b>  - Icebreakers is configured so that users remain anonymous 
to each other.  The only thing they know are the non-unique demographic identifiers.  This configuration allows for 
preservation of social currency and enables the free exchange of ideas and values.  WPCF has written a report, 
<a routerLink="/barriers" > 'Barriers to Communication' </a> to 
detail how the communication barrier is reduced by 90%.
<br><br>
<b>New Mathematical Insight</b> - There is a huge argument over wheather world peace is even possible or not.  Many 
people say it is not.  Religious people belive there will be peace toward the end of days and that is something God 
wants us to work towards.  Well, WPCF has coined a statistical argument that shows the end states will be world peace.
It is similar to the logic behind statistical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.  It shows that the end state is 
world peace as a result of learning about what separates us and what bonds us after communicating over a long period of 
time.  The rate at which we communicate and socialize with each other is the limiting factor... You can find more 
details in our report <a routerLink="/statistics" > 'The Statistical Argument for World Peace' </a>
</p>
     <h3> So, what do we have for you to do?</h3>
     <p class = "background container">
    <br><br>
    Well, that depends on your belief in us and 
    your desired level of engagement.  Are you actively trying to push for peace or passively?
    Are you fully convinced with us or are you skeptical?  Just to note here, WPCF has published our 
    argument on a systemic social mechanism that seems to all but guarantee peace over a year ago and it 
    has yet to be countered...
</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3> First things first.  Please donate.    </h3>
    <p class = "background container">  
      <br><br>
      World Peace goes towards creating a better, safer future for all 
      of us, we all have to chip in a bit.  You do not need to donate much, WPCF can make use of $1 USD. Everyone knows 
      about karma and it is obvious that donating to make the world more peaceful will bring you good karma, the 
      question is how much to donate.  Islam prescribes donating 2.5% of your yearly profits to charity... WPCF is an 
      approved 501(c)(3) non-profit and per our articles of incorporation, we are a charity organization.  
      So visit our <a routerLink="/donate" > donation page </a>
       and then come back here and continue reading 
      as to what you can do next.
 <br><br>
</p>
 <h3>If you are actively trying to push for peace now, we have 6 things you can do right now...</h3>
<br><br>
 <ol class = "background container">
  <li>  <a 
    href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mudib.ghostwriter&hl=en_US&gl=US'>
   <b>Download the application, Icebreakers </b>
   </a> - Icebreakers is currently available on android devices on the google 
    play store.  Don't worry if you don't have an android device, you can use your mac or pc with an emulator.  When 
    you download the application, you have to register a profile.  There are only 5 fields you are required to fill out ( 
      Date of Birth, Country, City, Ethnicity, Language
    ). 
    <br><br>
    Oce you have registered your profile, follow our storyboard to hold a cross-cultural conversation.  You can only 
    hold 5 cross-cultural conversations at 1 time. You will have to close the connection to open the next one. WPCF 
    suggests starting off with one of the following questions:
    <br><br>
    1. Are we friends? (candle, knot, heart )<br>
    2. What hidden bonds do we have? (knot, candle, moon) <br>
    3. What do we hate about each other? (candle, sword, heart)<br>
    4. What do we have to learn about each other? (compass, heart, apple, knot) <br><br>

    In case you are confused, we have a  <a routerLink="/appdesign" > storyboard page </a> with an 
    example so you can follow along.

    Don't stop there... WPCF also has 6 games you can play with Icebreakers.  I haven't had the time to make the web pages, 
    but now that you get the general idea, here are the games:
    <br>
    <br>
    <b> Game 1: </b>Connect the Dots Cross Cultural Game: Find out what separtes you and what bonds you with a 
    stranger in another culture. All these conversations go towards world peace.
    <br>
    <b>  Game 2: </b>Find your BFF: Ask another person 'Are We Friends?' with Icebreakers and see what the pen 
    of your heart shows you. You may find your BFF. All these conversations also go towards world peace.
    <br>
    <b>  Game 3:</b> Find your Love: Ask your sought gender 'Are We Lovers?' with Icebreakers and see what the 
    pen of your heart shows. 
    You may find your lover. All these conversations also go towards world peace.
    <br>
    <b> Game 4: </b>Terrorist Hunter Killer: Ask a question that strikes right at the heart of someone 
    from a country with a lot of terrorists. Your heart based conversation may just change the 
    heart of a Terrorist and shed new light. All these conversations also go towards world peace.
    <br>
    <b> Game 5: </b>Hide & Seek: Have your friend go into the city and hide. You use the application to
     try and find your friend by reading the messages. This is great for the intelligence community.
    <br>
    <b> Game 6:</b> Hone your heart. Hone various aspects of your heart by practicing drawing forth answers to 
what you seek. This is great for the spiritual community
<br><br>
Remember, each cross-cultural conversation is a brick in the house of peace and thus pushes us ever closer to 
peace.  Remember, each time you use Icebreakers, it makes it more popular and will make other people want to use it.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    If that is not enough, or if that is to much, we have something else for you.  Post our social memes (We have 
    55 general, <a routerLink="/FOoverview" > fight oppresion memes</a>).  My friend 
    tells me they are stickers, not memes, but iStupid and I don't 
    have the time to figure that out.  Posting a meme on your story or wall or page or whatever social media account
    you have, creates social pressure on other people to be adverse to violent measures.  Visit our 
    Fight Oppression Meme Overview page to find the ones that suite you.
  </li>
  <br>
<li>
Speak About WPCF, our movement, our application, our systemic social mechanism, our technological advancements, anything 
and everything.  This will help us proliferate by raising awareness and gaining approval.  Take a minute to stop and 
tell a friend.  Text them this website page and ask them what they make of this.  Is this real or is this a scam?
</li>
<br>
<li>
  We have a vast <a routerLink="/instagram" > social media precense.</a>
    Visit our Facebook Page, Facebook Group, Instagram page or meetMe profile.  
  Follow and like us there.  It will surely help us by expanding our social network where we can send blasts to so you 
  are updated immediately on the latest...Just note, we are on social hiatus until we find a source of funding.
</li>
<br>
<li>
  <a routerLink="/volunteer" > Volunteer</a>
   - We have a ton of volunteer opportunities, all of which can be done remotely.  Visit our volunteer page 
  and find what suites you.  If you have a computer, internet access and time, you can help WPCF.  We will make it simple
  and easy, just contact us with what your interested in and we will provide instructions.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Perform the <a routerLink="/GWAExp1P" > heart experiment.</a>   
The heart experiment is reproducible.  When you replicate it, you bolster our position 
because WPCF can then say, hey look, other people are getting it to work also.  Just be sure to send in your results so we 
can record it and say x people have gotten it to work.

 <h3 class = " container">Ok, Ok, if you've gotten this far down the page, your probably not convinced or just want something 
  passive to do.  Well, we have 5 things for you.

 <br><br>
 <ol class = "background container">
  <li>
    Review our logical argument diagram.  WPCF has created 10 reports that detail the systemic social mechanism 
    that seems to all but guarantee peace. The logical argument diagram gives straight forward if-then argument 
    of our systemic social mechanism.  
     If you disagree with any of our points, then you can visit the accompanying report to see our rationale.

    Review over our diagram on the systemic social mechanism.  How else would you be able to comprehend this easily 
    without a diagram....Maybe your smart, but I'm not, I would need one of these things.  In this diagram, we

 <p class = "background container">  
 Doing these things will help you passively understand why WPCF is the strongest force for peace.  Reading is a 
 passive way to join the World Peace Movement.  Once you are convinced yourself, you can convince others and 
 help us grow.  Once you are convinced, you can become an active member of the world peace movement.
