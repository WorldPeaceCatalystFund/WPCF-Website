    <p class = "background container">  This article aims to explain the power of using images to mediate the conversation between two people.
        It goes on to show that Icebreakers is the app to use to create cross-cultural connections because you
        can make a meaningful connection very fast. To understand the purpose the images serve in the
        conversations, we should take a look at the single person usage. We will also look at such concepts as a
        universal language, the rationale for using symbols, semiotics, and the Quranic knowledge involved. 
        
        <br><br>
        For a brief recap, let’s go over what Icebreakers is. Icebreakers is a new social semiotic application.
Users ask a question to each other by picking a few symbols to represent the question. The application
then retrieves an image stream thought to contain a message that represents an answer to the
question. Users can use the app to answer their own questions or to hold a conversation with someone
else. Users remain anonymous, with only non-unique identifiers displayed.
        <br><br>
        Let’s go over the concept of divine messages in everyday life. All religions consider that God or some
higher power sends messages in everyday life. In these messages, certain actions, objects, or events can
serve to symbolize a greater meaning in context. Another concept prevalent in religion is that God
controls everything. Everything is in His power and the messages, which require a very high order of
organization and control, are an indication that He controls everything. It is important to note that while
everything is in God’s power, it is very unlikely that the rules of physics will be broken when one of these
messages is sent. 
<br><br>
I’m of the thought that God is merciful and wants to answer us every time we reach out to him. In this
limit that the laws of physics must not be broken, the implication is that not everyone receives messages
as often as they ask. I suppose that there are people who receive His messages regularly, but these are
people who have attained a level of understanding and a relationship with God so that it is such. In
Islam, these people are said to have mastered their Deen. 


        <br><br>
        Now, consider a series of randomly drawn images and further consider whether the series of images
conveys a message or not. I envisage five possibilities concerning a message being formed:
        <br>
        1. The images are random and there is no message.<br>
        2. It is a message because that is the way it works. (As in, we ask a question and the answer
comes to us). 
<br>
3. It is a message through some metaphysical mechanism of the heart that is not understood.
(Albeit random images, maybe the heart has an affect…The faculty of heart is something we
do not full understand). 

<br>
4. It is a message inspired by the divine (Remember, God controls everything; so, this is easy to
do and does not break the rules of physics). 
<br>
5. The devil or his minions are trying to misguide you (They may be able to exert some control
on which images get chosen and they are always trying to misguide humankind).
<br><br>
It is very clear, that although there are 5 possible ways that it could work, there are 2 basic outcomes,
either the images form a message or not. The actual mechanism and reasoning to why the images form
a message is unknown and requires further thought and experiment. At the present time, I can only
devise an experiment to show that we have a significant effect on drawing a message from randomly
chosen images. My hypothesis is that humans have a divine ability to draw a coherent and relevant
message from randomly drawn images based off symbolic questioning. My preliminary experimentation
shows this is true, I plan to create an experiment for you to conduct on your own.
<br><br>


Another question that comes to my mind is, how do you differentiate between a divinely inspired
message and one from the devil? You may already know the answer to this or are at least familiar with
the concepts involved. The Quran has many verses that support the idea that the messages from the
heavens are clear, and we recognize them as different. Take a look at this verse from the Quran: 

        <br><br>
        “Say: ‘Praise be to God. He will show you His Signs and you will recognize
them. Your Lord is not heedless of anything you do.’” (Qur’an, 27:93)
        <br><br>
        You get the idea, when God sends a message it is clear compared to one received from the devil.
        <br><br>
        The next point I would like to draw your attention to is how many messages can be formed. There are
750 billion images on the internet. You know the saying about an image being equal to a thousand
words. That means there are over 750 thousand billion words that can be formed. You can rationalize
that: with so many words to choose from, any message can be formed by gathering a series of images. 

<br><br>
Consider symbols and imagery as a language. One image or symbol can connote multiple meanings.
Symbols are a sort of universal language. Supposing there is a universal language, it is easy to conceive
that there is probably a common understanding that we can agree upon. Actually, many world peace
organizations focus on establishing a common understanding between human relations. In fact, this
common understanding is in the process of being developed and has been developing over thousands of
years. The social mechanism I am proposing speeds up the process of discovering this common
understanding. 
 
<br><br>
I want to show why using symbols to question is powerful. Everyone can draw their own meaning from
symbols. In fact, we have developed our own languages based on different valuation of symbolic
occurrences. Now consider that some symbols hold a universal truth, meaning that everyone can derive
the same meaning from the symbol. This type of relevance means that you can pose any question by
picking a few symbols and most people will understand it. If we had a list of all the symbols that held a
universal truth, we would have a universal language to engage with to develop a common
understanding. Thus, everything can be said with symbols and they form the basis of human thought.
<br><br>
Not only will most people understand it, it is an effective way to communicate. When you pick a few
symbols to represent a question, and you search for random images based off those symbols, you are
not drawing completely random images anymore. The universal language in symbols means that you
point the computer to draw images from a specific subset of images. This subset may have a relevant
images that answer your question.
<br><br>
This point is abstract and difficult to explain. Symbolic questioning gives a direction to the image picking
algorithm. The randomness part is where the magic happens. I argue that things happen for a reason
and are not entirely random. Be it one of the three possibilities I laid out for a coherent message or
some other unknown reason, the fact that we can point the image picking algorithm in a direction
makes it infinitely easier to pick out images that pertain a message. 
<br><Br>
        Putting the points together with the idea that God controls everything, if you drew random images, you
could potentially receive a divine message. It would never break the rules of physics, and everything
could be communicated. This makes sending a divine message more plausible and easier to send more
frequently.
<br><br>

One of the questions I had while formulating this whole concept is, how often could one receive a divine
message? I am from the sciences and most things in nature follow what is called a normal distribution. I
hypothesize that the distribution of frequency increases and would follow what would be seen as a
natural distribution of frequency. That means about 65% of people will be able to receive a message
65% of the time. We won’t know this for certain until enough people are using the application. 

<br><br>
We know that God guides whomever He wants, and this can be considered a sort of guidance. I
rationalized that there was probably a hierarchy of questions that could be asked and potentially be
answered, depending only on your relationship with God. This is akin to those who have mastered their
Deen receiving what they want. There are some questions everyone can ask and some only some
people can ask. For example, everyone can ask for the guidance they need for tomorrow and reasonably
expect an intelligible answer. 
<br><br>
This is called divination. You may be familiar with the term, and it is shunned in religion. I met with an
Imam to ask whether this type of questioning was as per the rules of Islam. He said it is not, because
you cannot create something that expects God’s response at the push of a button. I think it is safe to
say that it is the same in other major religions. What I would like to consider is the power of using this
concept in cross-cultural communication. The cross-cultural aspect was approved by the Imam and I
suppose it is similar in other major religions as well. 
<br><br>
When I went to the Imam a second time to discuss the possibility of it being a heart effect. He was
utterly confused. He was not sure if it was divination anymore. I just want to note this for anyone
interested in giving this app a try. It is a grey area in the religions, and is not fully understood. If it is a
heart effect that we are dealing with, there should be nothing wrong. However if it is divination, it is
illegal in most religions. Experimentation and thought will have to be given to this project to clear up
this dilemma. 
<br><br>
I want to contrast this design with another experimental semiotic device that was created by the
department of defense. In an effort to predict 9-11 type disasters, the DoD wanted to see if you could
predict future events through analysis of written text. This would be like newspaper articles from
around the world being fed through a machine. The machine then says xyz will likely happen tomorrow. 
<br><br>
It is known that sentence can be analyzed to pick out the concepts in it. In fact, a sentence converges on
a few ideas. The idea is that all the ideas being written about in the world today will naturally show
something of tomorrow. This never worked and I can explain why. Although a sentence converges to a
few concepts, by taking in all the newspaper articles from around the world, you limit yourself on the
variety of topics covered. All newspaper articles are more or less focused on the same events in the
world. Even if you take say text messages and emails and pump them through this type of machine, it’s
impossible to accurately analyze any personal texts because we each hold words (symbols) at different
valuations. You would not be able to differentiate between serious communication and harmless
chatter that contains the same words. 
<br><br>

chatter that contains the same words. 
<br><br>
Contrast this with my image based mechanism, symbolic questioning hones in on a subset of images and
there is a plethora of images that can be chosen to represent any answer. You don’t get this type of
variety and choice in an analysis of text. This is the key difference and preliminary experimentation
shows that the image mechanism works. 
<br><br>
Just food for thought, this is to say that the single person usage of the device I created can be used as a
9-11 event predictor. The caveat being that men of a certain caliber can use it to show future events
that may end in disaster. These men would be the modern day jedi. 
<br><Br>

Getting back to the social aspect, when you allow two people to converse over randomly drawn images,
they get to connect the dots in their own language. The random images may or may not have a
message. In any case, two very special things happen. One is that people get to bond in their own
language and level of understanding. There is a metaphysical bonding aspect over just communicating.
Remember, socialization is done through the veil of anonymity and non-unique identifiers; so, there is
social safety. The second is that if the random images contain a divine message, it allows the users to
get to the point very fast.
<br><br>
Some of these messages will be divinely inspired. If you create standardized questions whose answers
necessitate something about social bonding, you have a highly reproducible effect that is highly effective
at revealing what separates and what binds us. Eight billion people now have the ability to safely ask
each other questions and reasonably expect a divinely guided answer. This is the power of mediation in
the images.
<br><br>
There is now a standard method for revealing the social bonds of society. These bonds represent what
we know of each other that keeps us from fighting. It is the cultural connections that we live for. If we
knew all the things that we can say to each other to keep us from fighting, there would be no war. 
<br><br>
It has taken us thousands of years to reach the current level of societal bonding. Your regular use of
Icebreakers to hold a potentially divinely sparked conversation about bonding will surely reveal
thousands of years’ worth of socialization daily. We can mine for the bonds of society. With this
knowledge, we can avert war. You should be able to see the power of Icebreakers and the imagemediated conversation concept.
