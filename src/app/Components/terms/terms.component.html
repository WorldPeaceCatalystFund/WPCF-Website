                 All matters relating to or arising out of this Agreement shall be governed by and

                 <br><br>
                 <h5>BINDING ARBITRATION</h5> 
                 <br><br>
                 In the event that either party asserts that there is a dispute arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, such party shall first notify the other party in writing, specifying the
nature of the dispute and scheduling a meeting to attempt to resolve the dispute.
                 <br><br>
                 If no resolution is reached within thirty (30) calendar days of the delivery of the written
notice, either party may then elect to exclusively and finally resolve the dispute by
binding arbitration by filing a written notice of arbitration in accordance with this section
under the subheading “Binding Arbitration” and the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration
of the International Chamber of Commerce applicable at the time of submission of the
dispute to arbitration (the “ICC Rules”).
                 <br><br>
                 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the ICC Rules, the following terms and
conditions shall apply.
                 <br><br>
                 The arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Each party shall
                 have the right to appoint one (1) arbitrator within fifteen (15) days following the delivery
                 of the written notice of arbitration, and a third arbitrator shall be selected by those two
                 (2) party-appointed arbitrators within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the two (2)
                 party-appointed arbitrators.
                 <br><br>
                 The arbitration proceedings shall be held in Arlington, Virginia, United States of America
                 in the English language.
                 <br><br>
                 The parties shall equally bear the costs and fees of the arbitration, and each party shall
                 bear its own cost for its own legal expenses. The arbitrators shall apply the substantive
                 law set forth in the section of this Agreement under the subheading “Governing Law”.
                 Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted on a confidential basis.
                 <br><br>
                 The arbitrators shall specify the reason and basis for their decision, the reason for any
                 damages awarded and the breakdown for such damages awarded, and the basis for any
                 other remedy authorized under this Agreement, including but not limited to injunctive
                 relief or specific performance. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement
                 shall prevent us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief.
                 <br><br>
                 The decision of the arbitrators shall be considered as a final and binding resolution of
                 the dispute, shall be final and binding on the parties, and shall not be subject to appeal
                 or reexamination. The award of the arbitrators may be entered as a judgment and
                 enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.
                 <br><br>
                 TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT
                 TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDINGS, ACTION OR COUNTERCLAIM.
                 <br><br>
                 <h5>INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF</h5> 
                 <br><br>
                 We may seek injunctive or other equitable relief that is necessary to protect our rights
and intellectual property. All actions or proceedings related to this Agreement that are
not subject to binding arbitration will be brought solely in the state or federal courts of
the State of Virginia, United States of America. You hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of those courts for
purposes of any such action.
                 <br><br>
                 <h5>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h5> 
                 <br><br>
                 You agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be solely
between you and the Company.
                 <br><br>
                 YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE IN COURT OR ARBITRATE ANY CLAIM
OR DISPUTE AS A CLASS ACTION. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL ONLY MAKE CLAIMS
AGAINST US IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND CANNOT MAKE CLAIMS AGAINST
US AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OR AS A REPRESENTATIVE.
                 <br><br>

                 <br><br>
                 Our failure to act on or delay in exercising any privilege, power or right under this

exercise of such privilege, power or right or the exercise of any other privilege, power or

                 <br><br>
