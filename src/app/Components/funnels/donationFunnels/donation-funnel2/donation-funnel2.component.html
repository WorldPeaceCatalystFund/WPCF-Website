    <h2 class = "header2 background">I started a project that <strong> gurantees</strong> world peace.  That's right. <strong> Gurantees</strong> .  
        How you say?  Well, let me explain.</h2>


    <p class = "background container">
        <br>
    
   

        <br>

        I have spent about 30k on this project out of my own pocket. I have also spent about 50k of Google Grant money. I have added in about 400k+ worth of work into the 
        project. We have a working application, a full argument and are working to expand.
        <br><br>

        It should be easy to see that if we knew enough about each other, we would know what to say and what not to say to keep the peace.  If we understood each other, we would know 
how to interact with each other without disturbing the peace. 
        <br><br>
        If you don't believe me, just look at how many world peace non profits deal with teaching peaceful human 
        to human interactions.  They rely on the knowledge of the words and actions that separate us and that binds us.  This knowledge is what we have learned over the thousands of 
        years that 
        have passed as the world has evolved.
        <br><br>
    </p>
        <h2 class = "header2 background"> This knowledge is special  </h2>
        
    <p class = "background container">
        <br><br>
        
        There is only so much of it and there are only so many people who have it.  We need to have more of this knowledge and we need to 
        educate more people with this knowledge.
        <br><br>
        While many non-profit organizations focus on teaching people how to use this knowledge, there is no organization that deals with obtaining this 
        knowledge until now.  The World Peace Catalyst Fund has devised a methodology that obtains thousands of years worth of this bonding knowledge daily.
        <br><br>
        If you've made it this far, I assume your very interested in world peace.  So much so that you still want to know how the World Peace Catalyst Fund can gurantee World Peace.
        Well, like I said, it should be easy to see that if we knew enough about each other, we would know what to say and what not to say to keep the peace.  Currently, we know little. 
         If you 
        follow our call to action, we will learn more and soon we will know enough to keep the peace.
        <br><br>

        
          
      
        </p>
        <h2 class = "header2 background">  So what is our call to action?</h2><br><br>
        <div class = "row background ">
            <div class="column background "></div>
            <div class="column background ">
                
              
                <!-- <img src="./assets/Globe v1.jpg" class="funnelimage"/> -->
                Well, the World Peace Catalyst Fund has created a semiotic social media application that reduces the communication barrier by 90%, is safe and
                allows 
               for preservation of social currency.  Compare the 90% reduction to current social media like Facebook and Instagram which only reduces the communication barrier by 20%.
               <br><br>
               <strong> Our Call To Action</strong> is to safely hold a cross-cultural conversation with our application, Icebreakers. With our 
        application, Icebreakers, you can safely hold a cross-cultural conversation with someone from a different culture.  In addition, Icebreakers, relies on semiotics (natural 
        messaging), 
        which means it is an effective way to reveal the knowledge of what separates and what binds us.
               <br><br>
               So, we say we can gurantee peace because if everyone follows our call to action to hold a cross cultural application, we can reveal the bonds of society (knowledge of what 
               binds and what 
               separates us).  We can reveal thousands of years worth of this knowledge daily.  With this knowledge, politicians can then construct programs that facilitate world peace as
                opposed to wars.  <Strong>This will keep the peace.</Strong>
               <br><br>

   Do you want world peace?  I started a project that gurantees world peace.  That's right.  Gurantees.  How you say?  Well, let me explain.

It should be easy to see that if we knew enough about each other, we would know what to say and what not to say to keep the peace.  If we understood each other, we would know 
how to interact with each other without disturbing the peace.  If you don't believe me, just look at how many world peace non profits deal with teaching peaceful human

have passed as the world has evolved.

This knowledge is special.  There is only so much of it and there are only so many people who have it.  We need to have more of this knowledge and we need to 
educate more people with this knowledge.  While many non-profit organizations focus on teaching people how to use this knowledge, there is no organization that deals with obtaining this 
knowledge until know.  The World Peace Catalyst Fund has devised a methodology that obtains thousands of years worth of this bonding knowledge daily.

If you've made it this far, I assume your very interested in world peace.  So much so that you still want to know how the World Peace Catalyst Fund can gurantee World Peace.
Well, like I said, it should be easy to see that if we knew enough about each other, we would know what to say and what not to say to keep the peace.  Currently, we know little.  If you 
follow our call to action, we will learn more and soon we will know enough to keep the peace.  

So what is our call to action?  Well, the World Peace Catalyst Fund has created a semiotic social media application that reduces the communication barrier by 90%, is safe and allows 
for preservation of social currency.  Compare the 90% reduction to current social media like Facebook and Instagram which only reduces the communication barrier by 20%.
